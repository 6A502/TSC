# Node.js Community Contributing Guide 1.0

This document describes a very simple process suitable for most projects
in the Node.js ecosystem. Projects are encouraged to adopt this whether they
are hosted in the Node.js Foundation or not.

The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:

* Encourages new contributions.
* Encourages contributors to remain involved.
* Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.
* Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how
contributors can be involved in decision making.

This document is based on much prior art in the Node.js community, io.js,
and the Node.js project.

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.
* A **Committer** is a subset of contributors who have been given write access to the repository.
* A **TC** is a group of committers representing the required technical expertise to 
resolve rare disputes.

# Logging Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue, 
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses.

Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and
add appropriate metadata before the issue addressed.

Please be courteous, respectful, and follow the project's Code of Conduct.

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, binary files, etc. Even long term committers and TC members must use
pull requests.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed. Committers should try to avoid merging
their own pull requests and allow other committers to accept and merge them.

For non-trivial contributions pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that
contributors in other timezones have time to review.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection.
There is no additional "sign off" process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought
by committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer. The majority of contributions
should land this way without escalation to the TC.

If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how to get it to land
or if it should land then it should be escalated to the TC. TC members should regularly
discuss pending contributions in order to find a resolution.

# Becoming a Committer

All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in a timely manner,
and added as a committer, and be given write access to the repository.

Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through
proper review, and have other committers merge their pull requests.

# TC Process

The TC uses a "consensus seeking" process for issues that are escalated to the TC. 
The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among TC members.
If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote
is called.

Members can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate another committer
to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus seeking process to evaluate whether or
not to add this new member.
