## Introduction

The libuv project is one of the primary underpinnings of Node.js
as well as several other platforms.

This application is to enter the incubator with the goal of
growing the contributor base.

## History & Metrics

Created initially for Node.js to abstract its internal IO,
now used by many other platforms as well.

## Scope

The Libuv TLP will have sole responsibility and discretion over the libuv
project in the following areas:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Governance process and practices.
* Contribution process and practices.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators and Working Groups.

## Governance

All merges are done by one of the stated maintainers
https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/MAINTAINERS.md.
There's no other governance currently documented.

Upon admission into the incubator the project will work
with mentors to document its governance model and contribution
policies.
